==================

Version 1.0.0 is the first version of Link Investigator.

Changes compared to Link Analyzer:
* Add a Dutch localisation
* Add browser button to check the current page
** The button also indicates whether a page loaded succesfully or not
** The tooltip shows the amount of dead / skipped links versus the total links checked
** The counter will be set to indicate that some unavailable links were found
** The counter will be set shortly in green when all links are available
* Shortcuts: make them work
** The default shortcut to check a page is F4
** The default shortcut to check a selection is Shift+F4
* Add extra checks to detect more accurately whether links work (see README)
* Instead of only the HTTP status, also show the reason why it got color-coded as such

Options page:
* Rephrased some options
* Add option to automatically hide the statistics pop-up, after a set time of seconds (can be customized)
* Use a textarea for links to skip instead of a input field
